## Earthquakes Map
PHP website that shows a map with the points of Spain where earthquakes have occurred in the last ten days.

Earthquake information comes from the xml file: http://www.ign.es/ign/RssTools/sismologia.xml

The SimpleXML extension provides a very simple and easily usable toolset to convert XML to an object that can be processed with normal property selectors and array iterators.
